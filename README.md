Recent developments in neural network architectures have significantly increased the 
accuracy of image classification systems, especially thanks to the use of convolutional 
neural networks and transfer learning. Today, when creating a new image classifier, 
much of the effort is focused on building the image dataset used for training, a task that 
typically falls to experts in the modelâ€™s application domain. 
This project proposes the development of a web application that enables users without 
specialized knowledge in artificial intelligence to train and evaluate image classification 
models. The platform aims to simplify the process of building image datasets as much 
as possible, while also offering options for more advanced users to optimize the 
underlying model architectures. 
Project management followed agile methodologies, allowing for flexibility and 
adaptability. In the documentation process, elements from both Scrum and the Unified 
Process were combined, yielding the benefits of each: the flexibility, utility focus, and 
continuous delivery of agile mthods, along with the structure, detail, and formality of the 
Unified Process. 
This project was developed using technologies, tools, and practices widely adopted in 
the software industry, reaching a scalable, modular, high-performance solution that has 
been containerized and deployed on a server for access via the internet. 
The resulting application allows users to create accounts and, via a web browser, 
manage image datasets and train image classification models. Each user can create and 
manage their own image datasets by easily uploading and labeling images. These 
datasets can be shared with other users and used to train custom image classification 
models. Once trained, models can be evaluated by users using certain metrics generated 
during training, used for inference, or downloaded for use outside the application. For 
model training, the application offers both architectures implemented from scratch and 
pre-trained models that have already learned to distinguish features in images. This latter 
aspect enables very good results without the need to use large image datasets.
